### Sales Forecasting with Prophet

This project demonstrates the use of Facebook Prophet for time series forecasting, specifically tailored for sales forecasting in the grocery and produce categories. The pipeline is automated to preprocess data, fit the forecasting model, evaluate performance, and visualize the results.

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the [Kaggle Store Sales Time Series Forecasting Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/data).
For simplicity, only the train set has been used to build the entire model.

The current implementation focuses on produce and grocery categories, the methodology can easily be extended to other product categories as well.
